                Welcome to my virtual living room. Sit down and make yourself at home.
                Would you'd like a coffee? This place is supposed to be a creative outlet for me and
                I'll fill it with more and more articles and projects as I go. As I'm writing this,
                I'm just getting started
                <br><br>
                I'm a Data Scientist by trade, but I don't like to be restricted by the label
                and have projects and  that span the whole programming world.
                <br><br>

                I'm Tim Keller, and I have been working in Data Science for quite a few years now.
                I've worked for several companies throughout Germany, developing AI tools to support their businesses.
                My experience ranges from prediction and recommendation to anomaly detection and NLP - you name it,
                and I've likely tackled it at least once. I pride myself not just on being able to write rudimentary
                scripts to get a PoC running, but on being capable of building an entire application,
                including big data pipelines, CI/CD, cloud infrastructure, and whatever else is needed
                to get the product up and running. Recently, I've transitioned from being solely an
                individual contributor to taking on more of a mentorship role. Currently,
                I am the tech lead of a team of amazing individuals, whom I am striving to support as well as I can.
